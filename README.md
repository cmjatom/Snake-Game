# Next.js Snake Game

This is a browser-based version of the classic Snake game, built with Next.js and React.

## Project Overview

The game initializes with a snake positioned randomly on the board. The snake moves continuously and changes direction based on user input from the arrow keys. A fruit item appears randomly on the board, which the snake can consume to increase its length and the player's score. The game ends if the snake collides with the board boundaries or itself.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`
3. Start the development server with `npm run dev`

## Game Rules

- Use arrow keys to control the snake's movement.
- The snake will move continuously in the direction of your last input.
- Consume fruit items that appear randomly on the board to increase your score.
- The game ends if the snake collides with the board boundaries or itself.
